# Feature Specification: SAP ABAP SY-UNAME Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `001-sap-abap-sy`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "sy-uname의 전달·전파 경로(assignment → structure → internal table → DML / RFC / PERFORM)를 정적으로 추적해, 최종적으로 어떤 Z*/Y* 테이블, 어떤 RFC, 어떤 필드에 영향을 주는지 자동으로 리포팅하는 ABAP 기반 정적 분석기."
**Note**: The previous line had encoding issues; please re-enter the intended Korean text.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
    Extract: SAP ABAP context, sy-uname tracking, static analysis requirements
2. Extract key concepts from description
    Identified: sy-uname (actor), data flow tracking (action), Z*/Y* tables (data), static analysis (constraint)
3. For each unclear aspect:
    Mark specific clarifications needed
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
    Define user flows for analysis execution
5. Generate Functional Requirements
    Each requirement testable and specific to tracking needs
6. Identify Key Entities
    Analysis results, taint paths, confidence levels
7. Run Review Checklist
    Check for completeness and clarity
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

##  Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
-  Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an SAP ABAP developer or security analyst, I need to understand where user information (sy-uname) flows through our custom code and which database tables or remote functions it affects, so I can ensure proper data privacy compliance and identify potential security risks without manually reviewing thousands of lines of code.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an ABAP program containing sy-uname assignments, **When** I run the analysis on that program, **Then** I receive a complete report of all Z*/Y* tables where sy-uname data is written
2. **Given** a complex ABAP program with nested includes, **When** I analyze it in LOCAL_ONLY mode, **Then** the tool tracks sy-uname within the specified scope and marks external calls as OUT_OF_SCOPE
3. **Given** an ABAP program using sy-uname in RFC calls, **When** I run the analysis, **Then** the tool identifies all RFC functions receiving tainted data with their destinations
4. **Given** an ABAP program with indirect assignments (sy-uname -> variable -> structure -> table), **When** I analyze it, **Then** the complete taint path is documented in the results

### Edge Cases
- What happens when sy-uname is assigned through field-symbols or data references?
- How does system handle dynamic table names or RFC destinations?
- What occurs when sy-uname flows through MOVE-CORRESPONDING statements?
- How are circular dependencies or recursive includes handled?
- What happens with very large programs exceeding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum program size/lines not specified]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept REPORT or INCLUDE names as analysis starting points
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect all direct assignments from sy-uname to variables, structures, and internal tables
- **FR-003**: System MUST track data flow through INSERT, UPDATE, MODIFY, DELETE statements affecting Z*/Y* tables
- **FR-004**: System MUST identify RFC calls (CALL FUNCTION) that receive tainted data as parameters
- **FR-005**: System MUST trace PERFORM and CALL METHOD invocations passing tainted data
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide confidence levels (High/Medium/Low) based on analysis certainty
- **FR-007**: System MUST output complete taint paths showing how sy-uname reaches each endpoint
- **FR-008**: System MUST identify affected database fields (e.g., created_by, changed_by)
- **FR-009**: System MUST support two operation modes: LOCAL_ONLY (default) and FOLLOW_CALLS
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle special ABAP constructs (field-symbols, ASSIGN, data references, MOVE-CORRESPONDING)
- **FR-011**: System MUST mark dynamic targets (dynamic table names, dynamic RFC destinations) appropriately
- **FR-012**: System MUST generate results in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: output format not fully specified - CSV mentioned but structure unclear]
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain scope boundaries and mark out-of-scope references when in LOCAL_ONLY mode
- **FR-014**: System MUST process nested INCLUDE statements within the analysis scope
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance requirements for large programs not specified]

### Key Entities
- **Analysis Target**: The ABAP program or include being analyzed, containing the source code to be examined
- **Taint Path**: The complete chain of assignments and transformations from sy-uname to its final destination
- **Impact Point**: A database operation, RFC call, or method invocation that uses tainted data
- **Confidence Level**: The certainty assessment of each finding (High for direct paths, Medium for indirect, Low for dynamic)
- **Scope Context**: The boundary definition determining which code is analyzed versus marked as out-of-scope
- **Analysis Result**: The findings report containing all discovered impacts, paths, and metadata

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
